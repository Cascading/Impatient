# Cascading for the Impatient, Part 1

Part 1 - Distributed file copy
------------------------------

The lesson today is how to write a simple Cascading app. The goal is clear
and concise: create the simplest application possible in Cascading, while
following best practices. No bangs, no whistles, just good solid code.

https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient/tree/master/part1

Here’s a brief Java program, about a dozen lines long. It copies lines of text
from file ``A`` to file ``B``. It uses 1 _mapper_ in
http://hadoop.apache.org[Apache Hadoop]. No _reducer_ needed.  A conceptual
diagram for this implementation in Cascading is shown as:

Certainly this same work could be performed in much quicker ways, such as using
`cp` on Linux. However this Cascading example is merely a starting point. We’ll
build on this example, adding new pieces of code to explore features and
strengths of Cascading. We’ll keep building until we have a MapReduce
implementation of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf*idf[TF-IDF] for scoring the
relative ``importance'' of keywords in a set of documents. In other words, Text
Mining 101. What you might find when you peek inside
http://lucene.apache.org[Lucene] for example, or some other text indexing
framework. Moreover, we’ll show how to use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development[TDD] features of Cascading,
to build robust MapReduce apps for scale.

Source
~~~~~~

As explained in the introduction of the series, all code is hosted on github.
If you have not cloned the repository yet, please do it now:

    git clone git://github.com/Cascading/Impatient.git

First, we create a source tap to specify the input data. That data happens to be
formatted as tab-separated values (TSV) with a header row:

[source,java]
----
String inPath = args[ 0 ];
Tap inTap = new Hfs( new TextDelimited( true, "\t" ), inPath );
----

Next we create a sink tap to specify the output data, which is also TSV:

[source,java]
----
String outPath = args[ 1 ];
Tap outTap = new Hfs( new TextDelimited( true, "\t" ), outPath );
----

Then we create a pipe to connect the taps:


[source,java]
----
Pipe copyPipe = new Pipe( "copy" );
----

Here comes the fun part. Get your tool belt ready, because we need to do a
little plumbing... Connect the taps and pipes into a flow:

[source,java]
----
FlowDef flowDef = FlowDef.flowDef()
.addSource( copyPipe, inTap )
.addTailSink( copyPipe, outTap );
----

The notion of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflowi[workflow] lives at the
heart of Cascading. Instead of thinking in terms of mapper and reducer steps in
a MapReduce job, we prefer to think about apps. Real-world apps tend to use lots
of job steps. Those are connected and have dependencies, which are typically
specified by a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[directed
acyclic graph (DAG)]. Cascading uses
http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/3.0/javadoc/cascading-core/cascading/flow/FlowDef.html[`FlowDef`]
objects to define how a MapReduce app - a.k.a., a DAG of MapReduce job steps -
must be connected.

Now that we have a flow defined, the last line of code runs it:

[source,java]
----
flowConnector.connect( flowDef ).complete();
----

Place those source lines all into a `Main` method, then build a JAR file. You
should be good to go.

If you want to read in more detail about the classes in the Cascading API which
were used, see the
http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/3.0/userguide/[Cascading 3.0 User
Guide] and http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/3.0/javadoc/cascading-core/[JavaDoc].

Build
~~~~~

To build the sample app from the command line use:

    gradle clean jar

What you should have at this point is a JAR file which is nearly ready to drop
into your http://maven.apache.org[Maven] repo - almost. Actually, we provide a
community jar repository for Cascading libraries and extensions at
http://conjars.org

Run
~~~

Before running this sample app, you’ll need to have a supported release of
http://hadoop.apache.org[Apache Hadoop] installed. Here’s what was used to
develop and test our example code:

    $ hadoop version
    Hadoop 2.4.1

Be sure to set your `HADOOP_HOME` environment variable. Then clear the output
directory (Apache Hadoop insists, if you’re running in standalone mode) and run
the app:

    rm -rf output
    hadoop jar ./build/libs/impatient.jar data/rain.txt output/rain

Notice how those command line arguments align with `args[]` in the source. The
file `data/rain.txt` gets copied, TSV row by TSV row. Output text gets stored in
the partition file `output/rain` which you can then verify:

    more output/rain/part-00000

Here's a link:part1.log[log file] from our run of the sample app. If your run
looks terribly different, something is probably not set up correctly. Drop us a
line on the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cascading-user[cascading-user] email
forum. Plenty of experienced Cascading users are discussing taps and pipes and
flows there, and eager to help.

That's it in a nutshell, our simplest app possible in Cascading. Not quite a
``Hello World'', but more like a `Hi there, bus stop''. Or something.

Driven
~~~~~~

Let us get started accessing your *Driven* environment. Driven is an
application-performance management application that helps you visualize
you application development, debugging, performance tuning, monitoring and
other operational aspects for data-driven applications built on Cascading.

_Driven is free for developer use on cascading.io._

To get started, http://cascading.io/try/[download the Driven plugin]

NOTE: *How does Driven work?*
When you run your Cascading application, the framework underneath instruments
your code and sends these telemetry signals to your Driven server, which can
reside in the Cloud (cascading.io)  or be self-hosted. The Driven plugin, which resides close
your application, only sends the operational meta-data to the server for
analysis and visualization -- _no application data is ever transmitted_. The operational
meta-data includes the graph it constructs to run the application on the native
computational fabric (MapReduce, local..) as well as the counter information it
collects from the run.

Since this is a very elementary application, we will not have much to analyze - we
will wait for later parts in the tutorial for that. However, it is important at
this stage to learn how to setup and access your Driven environment.

When you execute your application, you will see the URL in your console prompt.
Your URL, will of course be different than the one in this screenshot.

This URL will give you insights about your application, some of
which we will cover as part of the tutorial. If you have not installed the Driven plugin,
you can still see how Driven will help you visualize such an application by following the
 https://driven.cascading.io/index.html#/apps/6890CE1FB70A4676B8BEFC296AC746B7[link].

NOTE: To take advantage of additional features such as comparing your application statistics
with historical runs, collaborating with teams, and managing multiple applications, we suggest
that you get a free API key at http://cascading.io/register. If you have registered and
finished the instructions to install the key, log in at https://driven.cascading.io
to visualize your application flow. We will cover cover various features of the Driven
application in the following tutorials.

image:driven-part1-a.png[]

We will get additional insights in later parts as we create more complex applications.
From the screenshot, you will see two key components as part of the application developer
view. The top half will help you visualize the graph associated with your application, showing
you all the dependencies between different Cascading steps and flows. Clicking on the two
taps (green circles) will give you additional attribute information, including reference to
the source code where the Tap was defined.

The bottom half of the screen contains the 'Timeline View', which will give details associated
with each flow run. You can click on the 'Add Columns' to explore other counters too. As your
applications get more complex, these counters will help you gain insights if a particular
run-time behavior is caused by code, the infrastructure, or the network.

To understand how best to understand the timing counters, read
