Part 1 - Distributed file copy
------------------------------

The lesson today is how to write a simple Cascading 2.1 app. The goal is clear
and concise: create the simplest application possible in Cascading, while
following best practices. No bangs, no whistles, just good solid code.

https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient/tree/master/part1

Here’s a brief Java program, about a dozen lines long. It copies lines of text
from file “A” to file “B”. It uses 1 _mapper_ in http://hadoop.apache.org[Apache
Hadoop]. No _reducer_ needed.  A conceptual diagram for this implementation in
Cascading is shown as:

Certainly this same work could be performed in much quicker ways, such as using
cp on Linux. However this Cascading example is merely a starting point. We’ll
build on this example, adding new pieces of code to explore features and
strengths of Cascading. We’ll keep building until we have a MapReduce
implementation of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf*idf[TF-IDF] for scoring the
relative “importance” of keywords in a set of documents. In other words, Text
Mining 101. What you might find when you peek inside
http://lucene.apache.org[Lucene] for example, or some other text indexing
framework. Moreover, we’ll show how to use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development[TDD] features of Cascading,
to build robust MapReduce apps for scale.  

Source
~~~~~~

Download source for this example on GitHub. You’ll need to clone the whole of
this multi-part series:

    git clone git://github.com/Cascading/Impatient.git

For quick reference, the source code, input data, and a log for this example are
listed in a https://gist.github.com/ceteri/2911686[gist].

First, we create a source tap to specify the input data. That data happens to be
formatted as tab-separated values (TSV) with a header row:

[source,java]
----
String inPath = args[ 0 ];
Tap inTap = new Hfs( new TextDelimited( true, "\t" ), inPath );
----

Next we create a sink tap to specify the output data, which is also TSV:

[source,java]
----
String outPath = args[ 1 ];
Tap outTap = new Hfs( new TextDelimited( true, "\t" ), outPath );
----

Then we create a pipe to connect the taps:


[source,java]
----
Pipe copyPipe = new Pipe( "copy" );
----

Here comes the fun part. Get your tool belt ready, because we need to do a
little plumbing… Connect the taps and pipes into a flow:

[source,java]
----
FlowDef flowDef = FlowDef.flowDef()
.addSource( copyPipe, inTap )
.addTailSink( copyPipe, outTap );
----

The notion of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflowi[workflow] lives at the
heart of Cascading. Instead of thinking in terms of mapper and reducer steps in
a MapReduce job, we prefer to think about apps. Real-world apps tend to use lots
of job steps. Those are connected and have dependencies, which are typically
specified by a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[directed
acyclic graph (DAG)]. Cascading uses
http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/2.1/javadoc/cascading/flow/FlowDef.html[`FlowDef`]
objects to define how a MapReduce app - a.k.a., a DAG of MapReduce job steps -
must be connected.

Now that we have a flow defined, the last line of code runs it:

[source,java]
----
flowConnector.connect( flowDef ).complete();
----

Place those source lines all into a Main method, then build a JAR file. You
should be good to go.

If you want to read in more detail about the classes in the Cascading API which
were used, see the
http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/2.1/userguide/html/[Cascading 2.1 User
Guide] and http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/2.1/javadoc/[JavaDoc].  

Build
~~~~~

The build for this example is based on using http://gradle.org[Gradle]. The
script is in `build.gradle` and to generate an IntelliJ project use:

    gradle ideaModule

To build the sample app from the command line use:

    gradle clean jar

What you should have at this point is a JAR file which is nearly ready to drop
into your http://maven.apache.org[Maven] repo - almost. Actually, we provide a
community jar repository for Cascading libraries and extensions at
http://conjars.org 

Run
~~~

Before running this sample app, you’ll need to have a supported release of
http://hadoop.apache.org[Apache Hadoop] installed. Here’s what was used to develop and test our example
code:

    $ hadoop version
    Hadoop 1.1.2

Be sure to set your `HADOOP_HOME` environment variable. Then clear the output
directory (Apache Hadoop insists, if you’re running in standalone mode) and run
the app:

    rm -rf output
    hadoop jar ./build/libs/impatient.jar data/rain.txt output/rain

Notice how those command line arguments align with `args[]` in the source. The
file `data/rain.txt` gets copied, TSV row by TSV row. Output text gets stored in
the partition file `output/rain` which you can then verify:

    more output/rain/part-00000

Again, here’s a https://github.com/ato/clojars-web/issues/162[log file] from our
run of the sample app. If your run looks terribly different, something is
probably not set up correctly. Drop us a line on the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!overview[cascading-user] email forum.  Plenty
of experienced Cascading users are discussing taps and pipes and flows there,
and eager to help. Or visit one of our user group meetings.

For those who are familiar with http://pig.apache.org[Apache Pig], we have
included a comparable script:

[source]
----
copyPipe = LOAD '$inPath' USING PigStorage('\t', 'tagsource');
STORE copyPipe INTO '$outPath' using PigStorage('\t', 'tagsource');
----

To run that, use:

    rm -rf output
    pig -p inPath=./data/rain.txt -p outPath=./output/rain ./src/scripts/copy.pig

That’s it in a nutshell, our simplest app possible in Cascading. Not quite a
“Hello World”, but more like a “Hi there, bus stop”. Or something.
