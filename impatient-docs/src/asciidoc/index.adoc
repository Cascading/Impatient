# Cascading for the Impatient

The Impatient series is a set of tutorials to get you started with
http://cascading.org/[Cascading].

This set of progressive coding examples starts with a simple file copy and
builds up to a MapReduce implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.

Prerequisites
-------------

The code of this tutorial is hosted on
https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient[github]. Please clone it onto your local
disk like so:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient

Each part has its own sub-directory in the repository.

In order to follow the tutorial, you will also have to have
http://gradle.org[gradle] and http://hadoop.apache.org/[Apache Hadoop] installed
on your computer. You do not need a hadoop cluster, local mode is sufficient.



In the tutorials, we will also use *Driven* as an alternative to viewing the application 
composition using the .dot file graphics. Driven is the application performance management 
product designed to help developers accelerate Cascading application development and management. 
Driven will give us additional visibility about our Cascading tutorial as we run it on the 
cluster. If there's an issue, we can immediately identify where it happened and narrow 
it down to the specific line of code.

You do not need to make any changes to your existing Cascading applications to integrate 
with the Driven application. To use Driven, the Driven Plugin must be on the runtime
classpath for your Cascading application. 

The cloud version of Driven is free for developer use. To get started using Driven, 
visit http://docs.cascading.io/driven/1.3/#_getting_started[Getting Started with Driven] to access all the
developer features and gain visibility into your Cascading applications (including apps 
built with Scalding, Cascalog, Lingual, Pattern or any other Cascading dynamic programming language).

[NOTE]
===============================
We will use the cloud-based Driven product for the purposes of this tutorial. Driven will 
receive the data from your application to help you monitor and visualize the development 
and the execution of your application. 

To use Driven, the Driven plugin must be visible to your Cascading application. In addition, 
your Cascading application must have network access to the Internet so it may send data 
to the domain name "driven.cascading.io" over port 443 (the default SSL port for HTTP). Note 
that the client side of Cascading will be the only Java process attempting to make a 
remote network connection. Neither Cascading or the Plugin will open an connection from 
within an Apache Hadoop cluster.

You can learn more about using Driven for your Cascading application at 
http://docs.cascading.io/driven/1.0/getting-started/index.html[Getting Started with Driven]

===============================

Gradle
~~~~~~

Everything has been tested with gradle 1.12. You can check your version of gradle

    $ gradle -v
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Gradle 1.12
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    ...

Hadoop
~~~~~~

For hadoop please install the latest stable version from the 2.x series. At the
time of this writing this means Apache hadoop 2.4.1.

    $ hadoop version
    Hadoop 2.4.1
    ...

Cascading is compatible with a number of hadoop distributions and versions. You
can see on the http://www.cascading.org/support/compatibility/[compatibility
page], if your distribution is supported.


IDE support
~~~~~~~~~~~

While an IDE is not strictly required to follow the tutorials, it is certainly
useful. You can easily create an http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]
compatible project in each part of the tutorial like this:

    $ gradle ideaModule

If you prefer http://eclipse.org[eclipse], you can run:

   gradle eclipse
